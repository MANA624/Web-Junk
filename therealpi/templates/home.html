            Who am I?
        </h2>
        <p class="info-text">
            Hello! My name is Matthew Niemiec, but you can call me Matt. I am a student at the University of Colorado
            at Boulder studying computer science. I am currently in my fourth of five years to earn a BS/MS degree,
            and am emphasizing my studies in network security, where I hope to work upon graduation.
            I wrote this site for a couple of reasons. One is to simply automate some tasks I needed done remotely.
            Another is to showcase to potential employers some of the work that
            I do outside of school and work, as well as to provide some easy access to some of my achievements. With
            that, you may be asking what this website is made out of.
        </p>
        <h2>
            What is The Real Pi?
        </h2>
        <p class="info-text">
            Well, I'm glad you asked! <strong>on the technical side of things</strong>, The Real Pi is a Flask
            application with a MongoDB database. It runs on a Raspberry Pi in the corner of my room being served by
            Apache, over HTTPS with a certificate from Let's
            Encrypt. The site itself of course runs on HTML, CSS, and Javascript, as well as elements from Bootstrap,
            JQuery/AJAX, Font Awesome, and a few other online libraries that made my life easier. If you are still
            interested after reading that, then please take a look at the
            <a href="https://github.com/MANA624/therealpi">Github repository</a>!
        </p>
        <p class="info-text">
            If that didn't mean anything to you, then know that I wrote this site myself, purely from code. No
            Wordpress, no Wix, no Dreamweaver. Just code. Though I'm more interested in security,
            I love writing software,
            so I tend to do it a lot outside of work and school. But, enough about that!
        </p>

        </h2>
        <p class="info-text">
            Please log in if I
            gave you a username and password (potential employers will see this on my resume, which may or may not
            be publicly posted on this very site). You will see my resume page with, well, my resume, as well as a
            deeper look into my work and educational experience that you can't fit on one page. There is also a contact
            page for anyone who wants to get a hold of me for any reason. If you log in, you'll see my Calendar page,
            where I keep track of my schedule and critical events that are coming up. You will also see my admin panel,
            as well as the site my roommates and I use to calculate how much we need to pay for rent.
        </p>
        <p class="info-text">
            With that, I hope you enjoy my site! Best wishes,
        </p>
